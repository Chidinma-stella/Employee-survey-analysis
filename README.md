- Data cleaning,
- Removing duplicates,

## Analysis 

### Employee Analysis 
![](employee_survey.png)
There were a total of 10 questions and 14,725 responded . The total agree count is 11k. The top 5 questions in which the employee agreed the most with are questions 1,4,2,9 and 5.the total disagree count is 3223.  The top 6 questions in which the employees disagree with the most are questions 6,3,8,10 and 7.
To get the total agree count the agree count and strongly agree count was summed up. The same was done for the total disagree count.

### Patterns in Department 
![](Pattern.png)
It has a total of 21 departments in which Planning and Public Works has the highest number of responses with a total of 4.5k in which it has the highest number of  agree count (3600) and the highest number of  disagree count (980). It's safe to say that they have the highest number of staff considering the total number of responses.  In which the question I know what is expected of me at work is the one they agreed with most with a total of 429 responses. And I have a best friend at work being the one they disagreed with the most with a total of 212 responses.

### Roles in the Department 
![](roles_in.png)
There are four major roles in the department. The supervisor, the director, the manager and the staff.
The supervisor role having the highest Agree count at 675 and director having the lowest at 92. Some of the agreed questions are question 1 which is I know what is expected of me at work, question 10 which is overall i'm satisfied with my job, question 2 which is at work i have the opportunity to do what i like to do best. and the one they disagreed with the most is question 6 which is i have a best friend at work.

### Recommendation 
From the analysis above the employees in planning and works department disagreed about being recognized or received praise from doing good works, so i recommend an employee of the week badge be given to the best employee in planning and works department this would enable them to see that their effort are being seen. Then the sherrifs department also diagreed on being satisfied with their job so i recommend another survey be carried out to understand why they are not satisified with their job.
